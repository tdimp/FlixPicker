# FlixPicker

Welcome to FlixPicker!

The purpose of this app is to help users manage their "movies I want to watch" lists. It allows users to search for movie titles and add each movie to a watch list (queue). From there, users can keep track of movies that they watch, moving each one into a separate list.

The secondary function of this app is to incorporate a "random" button that will select one movie from the queue at random. This is a feature targeted towards indecisive people who know they're in the mood to watch something, but aren't too picky about what they watch. Just hit the "random" button and let FlixPicker make the tough decision!
